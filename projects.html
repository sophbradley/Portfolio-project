            This was the final project for the SheCodes Responsive workshop,
            which I completed in October 2022. I had a lot of fun working on
            this project; learning to integrate responsive elements to my code
            for text and images, and learning how to do this on a multiple-page
            site. This project was also about learning how to make websites SEO
            friendly, which I actually found quite enjoyable to do!
            <br />
            <br />
            It was a bit challenging at times, to work out a good way to make
            the site responsive and trying to remember everything I had learnt
            over the previous few weeks. But I do feel like I learnt a lot and
            it was a fantastic experience to put everything into practice.

              This weather app was the final project of the SheCode Plus
              workshop that I completed in September 2022.
              <br />
              <br />
              This project used an API to get the current weather forecast in
              thousands of cities worldwide, and included a second API to get
              the forecast for the next five days.
              <br />
              <br />
              Learning about API's was fascinating, and learning how I could
              include that data into a site I coded was such an incredible
              feeling! I enjoyed learning how to understand the data returned by
              the API's, and how to navigate the information to decide what to
              include in the app, as well as how I wanted it to look.
              <br />
              <br />
              For this project I went with a fun retro space-scape design, to
              explore how just a few simple style choices could really impact
              the look and feel of web page (I also may have been watching a lot
              of Star Trek at the time ðŸ˜†). I really love how this turned out!

            This simple landing page was the first project I coded, and was the
            final project of the SheCodes Basic workshop I completed in
            September 2022.
            <br />
            <br />
            For my first full workshop in front-end development this was a great
            introduction. We had to create a simple landing page using HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript on any topic that interested us. I went with the
            benefits of reading, as when I'm not learning to code you'll
            probably find me absorbed in a good book! I truly think everyone can
            benefit from reading.
            <br />
            <br />
            I had no prior experience of coding, other than one free tutorial,
            and learnt so much in just a couple of weeks. I couldn't believe how
            far I'd come so quickly and how much I was enjoying myself!

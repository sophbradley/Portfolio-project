            This was the final project for the SheCodes React workshop, which I
            completed in February 2023. Studying React was a steep learning
            curve but I enjoyed every moment of this challenge! I can see how
            powerful using React is and I really appreciated learning how to
            organize my code using components.
            <br />
            <br />
            This weather app uses the SheCodes weather APIs to allow the user to
            search for the current and 5-day weather forecast for thousands of
            cities around the world. Integrating an API with React was a lot of
            fun, and being able to include other techniques I had learnt
            previously was a helpful exercise.

            Creating my personal portfolio was the final project for the
            SheCodes Responsive workshop, which I completed in October 2022. I
            had a lot of fun working on this project; learning to integrate
            responsive elements to my code for text and images, and learning how
            to do this on a multiple-page site. This project was also about
            learning how to make websites SEO friendly, which I actually found
            quite enjoyable to do!
            <br />
            <br />
            It was a bit challenging at times, to work out a good way to make
            the site responsive and trying to remember everything I had learnt
            over the previous few weeks. But I do feel like I learnt a lot and
            it was a fantastic experience to put everything into practice.

            This weather app was the final project of the SheCode Plus workshop
            that I completed in September 2022.
            <br />
            <br />
            This project used an API to get the current weather forecast in
            thousands of cities worldwide, and included a second API to get the
            forecast for the next five days.
            <br />
            <br />
            Learning about API's was fascinating, and learning how I could
            include that data into a site I coded was such an incredible
            feeling! I enjoyed learning how to understand the data returned by
            the API's, and how to navigate the information to decide what to
            include in the app, as well as how I wanted it to look.
            <br />
            <br />
            For this project I went with a fun retro space-scape design, to
            explore how just a few simple style choices could really impact the
            look and feel of web page (I also may have been watching a lot of
            Star Trek at the time ðŸ˜†). I really love how this turned out!

            This dictionary application was created with React, using two APIs -
            one to return the meanings, examples, and synonyms of the word
            searched for, and a second to return images related to the search
            term.
            <br />
            <br />
            I really enjoyed creating this application; including two different
            APIs, using the skills I had learnt previously, for example
            Bootstrap and CSS techniques, and to make sure it was responsive. It
            was a lot of fun to incorporate them, and to build another React
            website. Learning React is a lot of fun even though it can be
            challenging at times!

            This was the final project for the SheCodes React workshop, which I
            completed in February 2023. Studying React was a steep learning
            curve but I enjoyed every moment of this challenge! I can see how
            powerful using React is and I really appreciated learning how to
            organize my code using components.
            <br />
            <br />
            This weather app uses the SheCodes weather APIs to allow the user to
            search for the current and 5-day weather forecast for thousands of
            cities around the world. Integrating an API with React was a lot of
            fun, and being able to include other techniques I had learnt
            previously was a helpful exercise.

            This travel project was the final project of the SheCodes Responsive
            Add-On workshop. Using HTML, CSS, responsive grids, image filters,
            and HTML embeds, the assignment was to create a travel website
            containing useful travel information about a location of our choice.
            I created my page about Monteverde in Costa Rica, which I had
            recently visited.
            <br />
            <br />
            This was quite a quick project and I loved how it came together so
            well. The inclusion of embeds was so useful for this project, and
            gave a professional feel to the site. I can see how this would be so
            helpful in a tourism setting.
